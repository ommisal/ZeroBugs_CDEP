        <h2>Plastic-Bottles & Metal Cans</h2>
        <p>       We will recycle plastic bottles into the<i><em><u> polyster threads</u></em></i> and that recycled polyster threads are 
            replaced in shoes, clothes, mats and many other stuffs.  Plastic bottles can fit in construction   
            also using they filled with fillers like mud, sand and then paste with mixture of clay, sawdust 
            and little amount of cement. Metal cans will be used as raw materials for making new cans and 
            from this the more requirement of metals will be reduced.</p>

                <p>        Papers and Cardboards are recycle by shredding and pulping and other
                     different steps involves to make new materials. We will send this new 
                     materials to various business outlets or manufacturers for manufacturing 
                     purposes like newspaper printing ,Wrapping papers , printing papers and blown in 
                     cellulose insulators where the recycled papers are used.</p>

        <h2>Glass-Waste</h2>
        <p>  We will collect the glass waste and then by doing processes like melting ,crushing , 
            cutting theglass waste to make new products which we are going to divided in
             subcategories according glass quality such as new glass, sand from glass 
             crushing ,and bricks by cutting them into equals parts which are used for construction
             purposes. The new products which we are going to make are divided in subcategories. 
             This  helps to maintain circular economy as making products using recycled glass costs 
             less than making totally new glass products.</p>

        <h2>General Plastic-Waste</h2>
        <p>        We separate all the general plastic waste into thin plastic and hard plastic.
            General plastic waste can be used in efficient ways to make plastic bricks and 
            plastic fuel. Likewise plastic bottles, general plastic waste also be turned 
            into useful construction.  As the general plastic which we used for making plastic
            fuel have high calorific value and this fuel is much more efficient and environment
            friendly which doesn’t makes user compromise with the output.</p>

        <h2>Cloth-Waste</h2>
        <p>     Unlike other types of waste we collect the cloth waste for only basic need for processing 
            of cloth waste is to make it available in good conditions.By manual segregation any kinds
             of unwanted materials are removed and then it is put into the system where it is made 
             dirtfree and clean.After 
            the processing it is provided to the local businesses who recycle 
            the waste to make mats, clothes and other stuff from the cloth.</p>

        <h2>E-Waste</h2>
        <h3>Green Electronics for sustainable Future</h3>
        <h4>Manage Waste Accordingly</h4>
        <p>With technology constantly advancing, like a new electronics devices coming out every year,
            the rate at which we create e-waste is rising exponentially. So what do you
            do with the devices that you’re no longer using? Recycle. Thankfully, we can do it better..
            We recycle all electronics through a process called de-manufacturing which sounds more complex than it really is
            better to reuse donate or create an awesome art with it.</p>
